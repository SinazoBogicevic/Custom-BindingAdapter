# Custom-BindingAdapter
<h3></h3><br/>

**Before learning about creating your own binding adapters, you need to have a good understanding of how data binding works**

<p>pre-existing binding adapters are pretty much called everytime we use binding however to make our code more robust
  we can create our own custom binding adapters.
</p>

<p>custom binding adapters are great because they help us to avoid making many framework calls in the activity. 
  This really helps to reduce boilerplate code</p>
  
  <h3>What's in the app</h3>
  <p>The app is a simple counter that changes the heading and tint of the drawable depending on the counters value</p>
